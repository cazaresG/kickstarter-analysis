# Kickstarter Analysis Written Report

## Background

The client, Louise, wanted to analyze the collected data regarding the kickstarter campaigns related to financial goals.
Data was organized and analyzed with stastical tools, focusing basically in theatrical plays.

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
We began working with a Pivot table, organizing the data in a monthly basis along the year.
From a total number of 1,369 plays, 839 were successful, this represents de 63%.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
This analysis show that from a total number of 4114 projects the percentage of success was 53.11%. We used the *Central Tendency Measurements*
to find that the Median and most repeated goal (Mode) was $5,000. The 3rd Quartile or 75% of the total were $15,000 projects.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
From the Quartile Analysis we found that the Lower Bound retrieves a negative number, meaning that the 1st Quartile or 25% of the total are values close to 0.

*The Outlier Analysis chart shows the suspicious data*

## Results

- We conclude that the Outcomes based on Launch Date had an acceptable percentage of success rate.

- For the Outcomes based on Goals we can say that the normal distribution shows a median value sitting in the middle of the chart, being also the most repeated
  value. We conclude that this amount of $5,000 represents a tendency, for our client it would mean a valuable tool for the planning of forthcoming events.

- The dataset has some Outliers described in the *Challenges and Difficulties Section*, we recommend removing them from the dataset.

- Other analysis/charts that can also be done is the histogram chart, showing the respective ranges
